# Medium-range Trajectory Prediction Network Compliant to Physical Constraint for Oceanic Eddy

This paper proposed a novel neural network structure to achieve medium-range eddy trajectory prediction, named **ETPNet**, which is compliant with the physical constraint. This structure contains a variant of the long short-term memory (LSTM) cell, enhancing the dynamic interaction and representation ability of the features, constraints, and knowledge. The pipeline of the whole prediction framework is shown as follows:
